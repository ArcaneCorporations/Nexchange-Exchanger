# Nexchange-Exchanger
A fun experiment trying to create a UI for exchanging cryptocurrencies, primarily based on the Nexchange API.

# How to Use #
Simply add your desired amounts for the supported cryptocurrencies and specify an address to receive your funds. Then just click 'Make Exchange' to place an order for an exchange. After doing so, you should be given a unique reference code that corresponds to your order, and you will have a to verify that order through a cryptocurrency wallet or platform of your choice. Using your unique reference code, you can also track the stats of your order (confirmation, amount received, amount sent, transaction etc.) For detailed reference to the documentation of the API and the various options you can customize for, see https://nexchange2.docs.apiary.io/#.
